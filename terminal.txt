[2025-12-09 11:19:54] Robot: I believe robots and automation can enhance many tasks by handling repetitive or dangerous work, allowing people to focus on creativity and complex decision-making.
[2025-12-09 11:19:54] Robot: While some jobs may change or evolve, human skills like empathy, judgment, and innovation remain essential and irreplaceable.
[2025-12-09 11:19:54] Robot: So, rather than replacing people, robots are more likely to become valuable partners in many areas.
[2025-12-09 11:19:54] Robot (non-verbal gesture): look straight
